Overview
========

Managers are handy objects to communicate between workers, implementing the
"passing by message" design. Your managers must derivate from the `Manager`
class.

In order to interact with other workers, each manager aims to provide:
    - one `_Receiver` instance;
    - one `Emitter` instance, at least.

The emitter(s) controls the receiver with simple method calls.

:Example:

>>> emitter.doSomething(whatever, parameter=optional, to=send)

The code implementing the "doSomething_async" method is run by the receiver.

**The receiver and emitters only support one kind of communication:
ASYNCHRONOUS. By using this module you are forced to write event-driven code,
called requests (most preferably with callbacks)!**


The manager
===========

All the code implemented in the manager is executed by the receiver.

What methods of the manager get exposed through the emitter relies on name
conventions.


Name conventions
----------------

Because the manager will build the receiver and emitters from itself, the
methods of a manager can intend different purposes:
    - factorized code for the manager;
    - factorized code for the derivated classes;
    - code for the user of the manager instance;
    - code for the user of the receiver instance;
    - code to expose through emitters.

Name conventions helps to know what the method is for. Also, building the
receiver and emitters relies on those convention names.

:_mgr_*: namespace reserved for the `Manager` base class.
:_ex: namespace for methods to expose via the emitters.

The canonical form for exposed methods is:
    ex_<emitterName>_<methodName>

The 'ex_' prefix is mandatory.

The <emitterName> is the emitter name which this methods targets. This might
indifferently call it <apiName> since it defines the API of the emitter.

When exposing a method, the prefixes "ex_" and <emitterName> are stripped from
the name:

:Example:

>>> class MyManager(Manager):
>>>     def ex_thisEmitter_printInfo(self, info):
>>>         print(info)
>>> 
>>> manager = MyManager()
>>> handler = manager.getReceiver()
>>> emitter = manager.getEmitter('thisEmitter')
>>> emitter.printInfo('It works!')
>>> handler.serve_received()
It works!
>>> 

In this extract, the emitter 'thisEmitter' is sending the request 'printInfo'.


Helpers
-------

The `Manager` class has some facilities for your own managers.

:`stopServing`: allows to gracefully stop the receiver once called with `serve`.
This aims at being exposed.

:Example:

>>> class MyManager(Manager):
>>>     def ex_oneEmitter_stopServing(self):
>>>         self.stopServing()
>>> 
>>> oneEmitter.stopServing()

:`disable`: don't run the triggers for this emitter until `enable` is called.

>>> class MyManager(Manager):
>>>     def ex_oneEmitter_disable(self, emitterName):
>>>         self.disable(emitterName)
>>> 
>>>     def ex_anotherEmitter_parintInfo(self, emitterName):
>>>         print('info')
>>> 
>>> anotherEmitter.printInfo()
info
>>> oneEmitter.disable()
>>> anotherEmitter.printInfo()
WARNING: oneEmitter was disabled
>>> oneEmitter.enable()
info
>>> 


The emitter
===========

Requests
--------

The easiest way to send a request is to not worry about what is done. Simply
call any exposed method of the emitter.


Requests with callbacks
-----------------------

Writing asynchronized code usually requires callbacks. The callbacks must be
callable. They are defined on the emitter. They will be called once the request
was proceed and the response for this event was given back as a result.

There are 3 kinds of callbacks:

:onSuccess: executed when the receiver did not catch an exception while
    executing the request. The first argument of the callback is the result of the
    process.

:onError: executed when the receiver has catched an exception while executing
    the request. The first argument is the class of the exception, the second
    argument is the reason.

:onComplete: always executed. No argument is passed.

Callbacks are attached to a request like this:

:Example:

>>> def myCallback(result):
>>>     print("result of longRequest: %s"% result)
>>> 
>>> emitter.longRequest.addOnSuccess(myCallback)
>>> emitter.longRequest() # no wait
>>> # other statements
>>> emitter.honor() # block here.
result of longRequest: whatever
>>> 

At first, we assign myCallback to longRequest. Then, the emitter send the
request longRequest. At the end, honor will block until the longRequest send
back a result and will execute the callback myCallback.

There can be more than one callback of the same type for a request.

:Example:

>>> def myCallback(result):
>>>     print("result of longRequest: %s"% result)
>>> 
>>> emitter.longRequest.addOnSuccess(myCallback)
>>> emitter.longRequest.addOnSuccess(myCallback)
>>> emitter.longRequest() # no wait
>>> emitter.honor() # block here.
result of longRequest: whatever
result of longRequest: whatever
>>> 

Positional and named arguments are supported for the callbacks.


The receiver
============

The receiver executes the requests. It is added the method `serve_received` and
`serve` so it can serve emitters. The `serve_received` method returns True or
False whether it should continue serving or not.

:Example:

>>> while receiver.serve_received():
>>>     pass

The serve_received() blocks until all the requests events are handled. The
`serve` method is implemented exactly like that.

Each request ends before the next is started in the order they are called by the
emitter (they are internally put in a queue). The processing is sequential.
So, it's fine to implement methods like this in the manager:

:Example:

>>> class MyManager(Manager):
>>>     def __init__(self):
>>>         super(MyManager, self).__init__()
>>>         self.result = None
>>> 
>>>     def ex_oneEmitter_longRequest(self):
>>>         # Code taking a very long time; self.result gets True or
>>>         # False.
>>>         if condition:
>>>             self.result = False
>>>         self.result = True
>>> 
>>>     def ex_oneEmitter_getLongRequestResult(self):
>>>         if self.result is True: # Real value set by longRequest().
>>>             # doSomething()

The emitter will get the correct result as long as it calls
longRequest() before getLongRequestResult().

The emitter does not have to worry about the order of execution since it's
guaranted they are executed in the same order of the calls.

**However, if there are more than one emitter, the order of execution for the
methods is undefined accross the emitters.** Usually, hitting this case is a
good sign that the implementation needs a rewrite.


Error handling
==============

The receiver won't raise anything. Any error raised inside a receiver while
processing a request is logged-out.

Then, the exception class and the reason are passed to the emitter (without the
stack trace which is lost, for now). The emitter will call the callbacks defined
as onErrorCallbacks.

If no onError callback is defined, errors are re-thrown by the `honor` and
`process_results` methods.

:Example:

>>> def onError(error):
>>>     print("error %s"% str(e))
>>> 
>>> def myCallback(result):
>>>     print("result of longRequest: %s"% result)
>>> 
>>> emitter.longRequest.addOnSuccess(myCallback)
>>> emitter.longRequest()
>>> try:
>>>     emitter.honor() # wait here.
>>> except Exception as e:
>>>     onError(e)

However, it's best to make use of the callbacks because you konw exactly which
request failed and what type of errors it might raise.

:Example:

>>> def onError(error):
>>>     print("error %s"% str(e))
>>> 
>>> def myCallback(result):
>>>     print("result of longRequest: %s"% result)
>>> 
>>> emitter.longRequest.addOnSuccess(myCallback)
>>> emitter.longRequest.addOnError(onError)
>>> emitter.longRequest()
>>> emitter.honor() # wait here.

When a receiver get an exception, any pending request from this emitter is
ignored. When trying to recover from a failure, you have to think about that.


Limitations
===========

Passed values
-------------

The main limitation is about the parameters and the returned values whose must
be accepted by the internal queues. Don't expect to pass your SO_WONDERFULL
objects. Take this limitation as a chance to write good code and objects with
simple APIs. :-)

However, if you really need to pass objects, consider implementing the
`managers.serializer.SerializerInterface` class.


Effectively using the receiver and emitters
-------------------------------------------

Because communication internally relies on queues and that queues must be
**passed** to the workers, a manager is not helpfull in a worker. IOW, any
worker requiring emitters can only work with emitters built before the start of
the worker.


Receiver and emitter in the same worker
---------------------------------------

The emitter and receiver objects are usually aimed at being run in different
workers, one of them possibly being the main worker. However, it's possible to
implement a manager only to handle advanced communication between objects.

If you do this, don't use the `receiver.serve()` and `emitter.honor()` methods.
They will loop indefinitely and block. Instead, make sure to use
`receiver.serve_received` and `emitter.process_results`.

Be aware that even while using those methods there is a risk of race conditions.
This is because the receiver might not have received the requests when calling
`sever_next`. The same os true for `process_results`.  To avoid this case,
always implement the serving like this:

    >>> while emitter.process_results():
    >>>     receiver.serve_received()

There are good demos at the end of the module. ,-)
