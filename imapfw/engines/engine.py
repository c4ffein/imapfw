"""

Engines are users of the the drivers. The logic to apply to the data is put in
the engines, e.g. a 3-way merge engine. They are likely put in their own worker
and should mostly send events to work "with the outside" (the other workers).

Engines might be rather complex. Hence, they aren't meant at being exposed in
the rascal and best practices must be applied to the code.

Engines follows the components design pattern because factoring engine code is
not easy.

IOW, engines here are meant to be parent objects. Each is a pure data container
and provide some default processing code for the behaviour. It is the component.

Good components modeling seperate each related data into one simple and
dedicated component which is easy to re-use. Combine compenents into object
(called entities) to use them in the application.
